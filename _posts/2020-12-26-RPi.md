I usually spend my winter holidays visiting friends and family, but this is 2020. Finding myself with an excess of free time, I decided to build a wireless backup server, partly motivated by the difficulty my friend had in retreiving data from her laptop that failed to boot successfully after an update (Thank you, Microsoft). We recovered the data by removing the SSD from the laptop and inserting it into a hard disk enclosure. Retreiving data from my mac that way is impossible as the storage is soldered on to the motherboard (not to mention the difficulty in getting to the motherboard in the first place due to Apple's use of propreitary screws), so it is imperative that I backup my data regularly. While the mac has a feature dubbed 'Time machine' that performs an automated data backup at hourly intervals to a hard disk that is plugged in, I wouldn't be able to retrieve the data (if my mac stops working) and continue working on my backup (Windows) machine. Setting up a wireless backup server along with scripts to automatically backup the data should solve this problem.

In this blog post, I describe the procedure I followed to set up the server.
