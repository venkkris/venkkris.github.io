I usually spend my winter holidays visiting friends and family, but this is 2020. Finding myself with an excess of free time, I decided to build a wireless backup server, partly motivated by the difficulty my friend had in retreiving data from her laptop that failed to boot successfully after an update (Thank you, Microsoft). We recovered the data by removing the SSD from the laptop and inserting it into a hard disk enclosure. Retreiving data from my mac that way is impossible as the storage is soldered on to the motherboard (not to mention the difficulty in getting to the motherboard in the first place due to Apple's use of propreitary screws), so it is imperative that I backup my data regularly. While the mac has a feature dubbed 'Time machine' that performs an automated data backup at hourly intervals to a hard disk that is plugged in, I wouldn't be able to retrieve the data (if my mac stops working) and continue working on my backup (Windows) machine. Setting up a wireless backup server along with scripts to automatically backup the data should solve this problem. In this blog post, I describe the procedure I followed to set up the wireless backup server as well as the procedure to automate the data backup. Note that this setup only works if you are connected to the home wifi signal. I haven't set it up to be accessible from anywhere outside the home wifi network (i.e. through the internet) for security reasons.

## What you'll need:
* **A Raspberry Pi computer.** Though I used a [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/ "Raspberry Pi 3B+"), I'd recommend using a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/ "Raspberry Pi 4B"). The 3B+ model only has USB 2.0 ports whereas the 4B model has USB 3.0 ports that offer faster data transfer. 

* **A good power supply.** Don't skimp on this, especially if you attach two hard disks for redundancy. I had multiple instances of the server crashing due to low voltage from the power supply until I plugged it into a power source that pumps out 2.4 A at 5V DC. Vendors typically sell the recommended power source that is rated for 2.5 A at 5V DC. The 4B model uses a USB-C port for power input and also has a recommended power source (sold separately).

* **An external hard disk/USB drive.** You could use a hard disk lying around, but be aware that we will be formatting the drive, so make sure you keep a safe copy of all the files in it before following the procedures outlined here. We'll be setting up the server so as to store all the files in this hard disk, so make sure the hard disk has sufficient storage capacity.

* **A microSD card**, ideally larger than 16 GB. You *could* store all the data that you want to backup on the microSD card itself, in which case you'd need to get a microSD card with a large capacity such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-dp-B08GXXKY6P/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=dp_ob_title_ce "SanDisk 512 GB microSD card") 512 GB card. I had a spare hard disk lying around, so I setup the server to use the hard disk to store the data. The instructions in this post are for servers that use a hard disk connected to the Raspberry Pi through the USB port. 

* **A microSD card reader.** Some laptops come with an SD card port, so you could fit the microSD card into the SD card adapter and insert it into the appropriate port of the laptop. My laptop doesn't, so I bought [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W02VHM6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 "memory card reader") memory card reader to flash the operating system of the Raspberry Pi on to the microSD card.

* **A monitor/TV, keyboard and mouse (optional).** You *could* setup the server without ever connecting it to a monitor/TV, keyboard and mouse by logging in to the Raspberry Pi wirelessly using 'ssh', but this requires you to be comfortable with executing commands in the terminal. 

* **A case for the Raspberry Pi (optional)** for a clean-looking end product.


## Procedure to set up the wireless file server

### Flash the operating system on to the microSD card
Insert the microSD card into the SD card adapter and insert it into the SD card port on your laptop. If your laptop doesn't have the SD card port (like my MacBook Pro), insert the microSD card into a microSD card reader and plug in the card reader to your laptop. We'll use the [Raspberry Pi imager software](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) provided by the Raspberry Pi foundation for flashing the OS on to the microSD card. Install the Raspberry Pi imager software to your laptop. Once successfully installed, you'll be greeted with the following screen:

Choose the default OS, pick the correct SD card, and click 'write'. I chose to install the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit); this OS is pretty lightweight but does **not** come with a graphical user interface. We'd be running all the commands on the terminal anyway. You could choose to install the Raspberry Pi OS full, which comes with a full-fledged desktop environment.
