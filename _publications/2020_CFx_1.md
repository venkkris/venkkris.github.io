collection: publications
paperurl: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.0c01815
excerpt: 'This is my first publication! This is the first in a series to analyze the discharge mechanism of the Li-CFx battery. I used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to show that an intermediate product forms during discharge, and propose a plausible crystal structure for the same.'
