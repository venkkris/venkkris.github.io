I am a materials scientist and a Ph.D. candidate in materials science & engineering researching on batteries for electric aviation. Here's my recent [CV](https://venkkris.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon in 2018, I pursued an internship at the [ARCI Centre for Automotive Energy Materials](https://www.arci.res.in/centres-about-automotive-energy-materials) where I developed a novel route for the synthesis of core-shell gradient cobalt-doped sodium titanate and characterized their electrochemical performance in sodium-ion batteries. 

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2018 with a B.Tech and M.Tech in Metallurgical & Materials Engineering. I developed analytical models to obtain the temperature- and stress-dependent interface resistance and performed finite element simulation of resistance spot welding process incorporating my interface resistance models. I also synthesized and characterized yttrium titanate powders using solid-state and wet chemical routes, and investigated the mechanical properties of the yttrium titanate dispersion-strengthened steels. 

I was the president of the Engineers without Borders IIT Madras chapter, where I oversaw the implementation of the water purification project, which currently supplies drinking water to about 300 households. I also led the team that completed the solar electrification of Govt. Girls Higher Secondary School.
